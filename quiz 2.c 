a) In C, structures are essential for creating complex data types by grouping related variables under one name.

Required:

          i.               Write a C program to define a structure named employee that contains the following fields: name (a string of 25 characters), id (an integer), department (a string of 20 characters), salary (a float), and email (a string of 50 characters).


        ii.               Declare a variable of this structure type and initialize it with the following data:

i. name: "John Doe"
ii. id: 12345
iii. department: "Human Resources"
iv. salary: 55000.50
v. email: john.doe@company.com

 

Finally, print the values of the fields.

#include <stdio.h>

#include <string.h>



//define the employee structure

structure employment {

        chair name[25];

        int id;

        chair department [20]

        float salary;

        chair email[50]

};

int main() {

       //Declare a variable of the 

      structure  employee emp = {

              "John Doe",

              12345,

               "Human Resources",

               55000.50,

                "john .doe @company.com"

       };

       // print the  values of the f1

       print f ("Name:%s ,emp .name

       print f ("ID :%d/n", emp. id);   

       print f ("Department :%2f/n",emp1 .d

       print f (salary :%.2f/n", emp1 .sal

       print f ("Email :%s/n", emp1 .email)

       

       return 0;
